1. **Identifying and Hooking into `calculate_damage`**  
   The script locates the `calculate_damage` function using `Module.findExportByName()`. If the function is present, it prints its memory address. If not, it warns that symbols may be missing in the compiled binary. The function is then patched to modify its return value dynamically.

2. **Randomized Fuzzing of Damage Calculation**  
   A random value between `0` and `100` is generated using `Math.random()`. This value replaces the actual damage calculation, introducing randomness into the game's mechanics. This is a simple but effective fuzzing technique to test how the game responds to unpredictable inputs.

3. **Memory Patching with Architecture-Specific Writers**  
   The script modifies the function’s return value in memory using `Memory.patchCode()`. It uses:  
   - `Arm64Writer` for ARM64 (modifies `x0` register).  
   - `X86Writer` for x86 and x64 (modifies `eax` for ia32 and `rax` for x64).  
   After modifying the return register, a `ret` instruction is inserted to ensure proper function exit.

4. **Real-Time Manipulation for Game Hacking & Testing**  
   By injecting this patch, the script overrides the function’s logic in real-time, allowing damage values to be completely controlled. This technique is useful for game hacking, security testing, and debugging unpredictable behaviors in software.
