### **Technical Summary of the Frida Script**

1. **Modifying Input Validation in `verify_manipulated`**  
   The script locates the `verify_manipulated` function in memory using `Module.findExportByName()`. If found, it hooks into this function using `Interceptor.attach()`. This allows us to intercept its execution and modify the behavior dynamically.

2. **Extracting and Modifying Register Values**  
   Before the function executes, the script prints out CPU register values using `this.context`. It supports both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures, dumping the relevant registers. The script also identifies the function’s input argument (stored in `x0` for ARM64 and `rdi` for x86_64) and forcefully modifies it to `0xDEADBEEF`, ensuring a specific input is always passed to the function.

3. **Forcing a Successful Function Return**  
   After the function executes, the script modifies its return value using `retval.replace(1)`. This ensures that `verify_manipulated` always returns `1`, which could be interpreted by the program as a successful verification, effectively bypassing any checks.

4. **Real-Time Function Interception and Analysis**  
   By attaching to `verify_manipulated` and modifying its arguments and return values, the script enables real-time debugging, reverse engineering, and manipulation of the program’s logic. This showcases how `Interceptor` can be used for deep function analysis and live patching of application behavior.
